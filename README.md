I prepared 6 Web Pages with using HTML CSS and JavaScript. 
I chose topic "Online accommodation booking" and created web pages somehow like in Booking.com.

I have 6 pages: index.html is Home Page where given some overall information about web pages. 
hilton.html uzbekistanHotel.html hyattRegency.html and cityPalace.html are pages of Hotel which I chose. In these 
pages given information about rooms advantages and prices. Additionally, I have booking.html there I created form
for creating request of booking room in one of the hotels. User able to add information and submit it, after submitting 
in table under the form, this record will be created.

All pages have the same navigation bar and footer.
